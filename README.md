# STEM Firmware

This repository contains the Arduino firmware for the Seismic Tremor Excitation Machine (STEM). STEM provides large amplitude oscillatory motion to test structures constructed of household material, such as spaghetti and marshmallows. STEM was developed in collaboration with Engineers Nova Scotia for outreach in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (also STEM).

## Prerequisites
Firmware was written for an Arduino Uno using an Arduino motor shield. Compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE, version 1.8.4. 

Firmware is only one aspect of STEM. Unfortunately, mechanical drawings are not publicly distributed. If you are interested in reproducing STEM, please contact the developer. 

## Developers
STEM was developed by D.C. Hartlen, 2018.

Project was undertaken in collaboration with Engineers Nova Scotia

Firmware is distributed as is, were is. Neither the developer or Engineers Nova Scotia holds any liability.
